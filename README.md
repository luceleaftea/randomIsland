A Python script for randomly generating islands

See it in action at: https://random-islands.herokuapp.com/
(Note: It will take awhile to load, it needs to be optimized and the free version of Heroku can take a bit to wake up)

Based on tutorials from https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/
